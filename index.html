         <h3>10 Famous Cats Throughout History</h3><br>
         <p>Ted Nude-Gent – Mr Bigglesworth from Austin Powers
            This cat’s name is almost as funny as his film appearance! Known as Dr. Evil’s hairless Sphynx Cat from the Austin Powers movies, this famous cat was apparently a big fan of Mike Myers, despite his owner being his arch nemesis in the series.
             It’s been reported that Ted loved Mike so much, that he would spend all of his time sleeping on his lap – which apparently delayed shooting many a time</p>

        <h3>Why Do Cats Like Boxes?</h3><br>
        <p>There are lots of reasons that cats love boxes, but the main one is because they’re confined, enclosed spaces.
         Cats are ambush predators and finding confined places where they can hide, hunt prey and feel safe and warm is an instinctive behaviour. 
         Snug cardboard boxes fit the bill perfectly.</p>

        <h3>Do cats like music?</h3><br>
        <p>Have you ever tried to play your favourite song for your cat? You might have noticed that, no matter how hard the beat drops, your cat shows little to no interest in the music that you are playing to them.
         In rare circumstances, some cats have found specific music to be calming. Occasionally, cat shelters will choose to play classic music to their residents, believing that it creates a soothing atmosphere. Although cats don’t run away from music (unless you turn it up very loud!), there isn’t a lot of evidence to show that this is the case.</p>

        <h3>Do Cats Always Land on Their Feet?</h3><br>
        <p>Cats have an inbuilt balancing system called the “righting reflex” that allows them to orient themselves and land on their feet.
             But while cats are often able to land the right way up, it’s not the case that they always land on their feet.
              The height of the fall can affect their ability to land safely.
             For a long time, cats’ ability to seemingly always land on their feet has had scientists baffled since the early 19th century.
              Initially, it was thought that when cats were dropped they somehow managed to ‘push off’ the person’s hand.
            However, a French scientist called Etienne-Jules Marey in 1894 discovered this was not the case.
